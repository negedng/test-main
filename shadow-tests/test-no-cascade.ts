 *
 * The trailer format is: Shadow-replayed-{sourceRemote}: {hash}
 * When syncing from b→a, the source remote is "team" (the test harness default).
 * When syncing from a→b, the source remote is "origin".
 * Each direction's commits must only contain its OWN source remote name,
 * never the other's.
